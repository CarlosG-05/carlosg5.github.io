            <div id="about-me-text">
                <p>I'm a 2-year electrical engineering student currently living in National City, CA and studying at University of California: San Diego and I hope to specialize in circuits and systems. I love electrical engineering because electricity runs our entire world and without it, the world would have been a different place. I hope to be able to use my knowledge to create technologies that can help people live a better life. A specific field where I would like to help is in the area of Radio Frequency engineering where I can create new communication technologies to interconnect the entire world.</p>

                            <p>The premise of the line following robot was to indrouce my team and I to the R&D process and how to effectively communicate with the team in order to coordinate all the differet tasks that need to be done in order to completely make sure we had a finished product in the 2-weeks we were alotted. This project started in my ECE 5 class which was an introduction to electrical engineering as a whole where we learned many different skills. In this project we used CAD in order to develop a chasis that could house all the electronics while still being agile. We used the arduino microcontroller to impletment our PID control loop to drive the mototr based on the positioning revived from the row of photorisitors place at the front of the robot. We were able to tune the PID values using the potentiometers mounted on the back of the robot.</p>
